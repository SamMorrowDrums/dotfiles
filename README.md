# SamMorrowDrums and his dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

``` sh
git clone git://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

A .zshrc is setup for you, but it will look for and source a .localrc which is where you should put stuff you don't want checked into a public 
repo.

## Credit where where credit is due

The prior version of these came from [Tim Clem](https://github.com/tclem/dotfiles), who also credits the origins of his own:

> The original version of these came from [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), but I have ripped and torn 
> them beyond recognition. Many of my zsh tricks come from [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) which is well
> worth checking out in it's own right.
